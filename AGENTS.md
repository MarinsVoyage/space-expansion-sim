Guidance for agents in this repository.

## Coding Style
- Every codinglanguage uses Allman braces.
- Prefix local variables and function parameters start with `_`.
- Do not prefix object fields or properties with `_`.
- Use descriptive, self-explanatory names, longer names are fine.
- Always do modular, configurable solutions over hardcoded logic.
- Avoid hardcoding values when data/config can drive the behavior.
- When changes affect structure, routes, or assets, update all related references and files.
- Avoid obsolete, insecure, untrusted APIs.
- Always keep everything up to date.
- Descriptions and comments are brief and they need to explain in simple words what is each function, variable or any for of code doing, include what and why, plus an example that clarifies non obvious behavior e.g. if there are some bool or float or whatever what it means when value is true or false, or if value is 0 or -1 or 90 or such.
- Use simple English.
- if you dont understand something dont edit it.
